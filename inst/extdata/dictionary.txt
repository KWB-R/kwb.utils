# This is an example file defining a "dictionary". Each non-empty non-comment
# line is expected to be a "<key> = <value>" assignment. Each assignment assigns
# a value to a key. The value may contain placeholders that are marked by 
# angle brackets, such as "<placeholder.1>", "<placeholder.2>". If a value
# contains placeholders, they will be substituted with the resolved values for
# the corresponding keys. 
# 
# Example: The line "message = What a nice <object>" consists of the key 
# "message" and the value "What a nice <object>". The value contains the 
# placeholder "<object>". If the dictionary contains a line such as 
# "object = "summer", the dictionary key "message" will be resolved to 
# "What a nice summer".
